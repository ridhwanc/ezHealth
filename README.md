# How to Deploy
Either compile with javac, or import the archive file named ezHealth_Final.zip found in Eclipse Exports into Eclipse, and run Read.java (this is the file that contains the main method).
Upon running the program, wait until prompted to input a positive valued budget for your grocery list.
The program will then generate traces.txt which contains a saved copy of the output that is printed to the console.
